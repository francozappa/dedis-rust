## Goals ##

* Bryan, Ismail
    * industrial environments availability of efficient crypto
    * based on elliptic curves such as Ed25519
    * implemented in a more secure/type safe not garbage collected
    * for efficiency, deterministic performance and cross-language linkability

* Generic library
    * user change curves and suites
    * Eg curve: ECDSA with NIST or with Edwards curve
    * Eg suite: swap ECDSA and DSA

* Rust motivations
    * code benefits from a modern, safe, fast system programming language

* ICS motivations
    * most ICS protocol are cryptographically unprotected
        * no Confidentiality, integrity and availability

* ECC motivations
    * general pros:
        * small key size but high security level (scales much better than RSA)
            * less computation power and memory needed
            * eg: 256-bit key, up to 128-bit security level
        * no index-calculus attacks
            * unlike DLP mod p
        * generic DLP attack methods:
            * Shanksâ€™ baby-step giant-step method
            * Pollard's rho method
        * low computational power needed
            * Eg: RFID, smart phones
    * ECDSA pros:
        * fast signature and verification
        * deterministic algo allows deterministic implementation
        * random same message signatures (nonce based)
            * eg: sign twice same message, get two different signatures
    * ECDSA cons:
        * malleable signatures

    * Ed25519 pros
        * NIST std curve security opinable
        * Bitcoin is not using them

## Type System ##

### dedis/crypto public API ###

Go code example for ECDH:

    // Crypto setup: NIST-standardized P256 curve with AES-128 and SHA-256
    suite := nist.NewAES128SHA256P256()

    // Alice's public/private keypair
    a := suite.Scalar().Pick(random.Stream) // Alice's private key
    A := suite.Point().Mul(nil, a)          // Alice's public key

    // Bob's public/private keypair
    b := suite.Scalar().Pick(random.Stream) // Alice's private key
    B := suite.Point().Mul(nil, b)          // Alice's public key

    // Assume Alice and Bob have securely obtained each other's public keys.

    // Alice computes their shared secret using Bob's public key.
    SA := suite.Point().Mul(B, a)

    // Bob computes their shared secret using Alice's public key.
    SB := suite.Point().Mul(A, b)

    // They had better be the same!
    if !SA.Equal(SB) {
        panic("Diffie-Hellman key exchange didn't work")
    }
    println("Shared secret: " + SA.String())
